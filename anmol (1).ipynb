    "- **“<”** is the symbol/operator used to define ‘less than’  \n",

    "### EXPLANATION  \n",
    "In this code, the primary goal is to demonstrate list slicing techniques in Python. The code allows the user to:  \n",
    "- **Create** a list of string representations of numbers.  \n",
    "- **Access** specific segments of the list using slicing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### APPROACH  \n",
    "**List Creation:** The list `numbers` is initialized with string representations of the numbers from '1' to '10'.  \n",
    "**Slicing:**  \n",
    "- The first five numbers are accessed using the slice notation `numbers[:5]`, which retrieves elements from the beginning of the list up to (but not including) index 5.  \n",
    "- The last five numbers are accessed using `numbers[:-5]`, which retrieves elements from the start of the list up to (but not including) the last five elements.  \n",
    "- A specific range of items from index 2 to index 7 is accessed using the slice `numbers[2:7]`, which includes elements from index 2 to index 6.  \n",
    "**Output:** The results are printed, showing the first five numbers, the last five numbers, and the items from index 2 to 7.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### LEARNING  \n",
    "**List Slicing:** We learned how to use list slicing in Python to access specific portions of a list easily. Slicing is a powerful feature that allows for flexible data retrieval without the need for loops.  \n",
    "**Understanding Indices:** The code illustrates how Python indexing works, including how to use positive and negative indices to navigate through lists.  \n"

    "In this code, the primary goal is to demonstrate the use of nested lists in Python to manage student data, including names and their respective scores. The code allows the user to:  \n",
    "- **Input** names and scores for multiple students.  \n",
    "- **Store** this information in a nested list structure.  \n",
    "- **Calculate** and display the average score for each student.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### APPROACH  \n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "- A loop runs three times to collect the names of three students. Each name is stored in the variable `name`.  \n",
    "- For each student, another loop runs to collect scores for three subjects. Each score is converted to a float and added to the `scores` list.  \n",
    "- Each student's name and their corresponding scores are appended as a sublist to the `students` list, creating a nested list structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating Averages:** After collecting all input data, the code iterates over the `students` list, calculating the average score for each student by summing their scores and dividing by the number of subjects (3).  \n",
    "**Output:** Finally, the average score for each student is printed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### LEARNING  \n",
    "**Nested Lists:** We learned how to use nested lists in Python to organize related data, in this case, students' names and their scores. This allows for more complex data structures while maintaining clarity.  \n",
    "**Looping for Input:** We practiced using loops to collect input multiple times, enhancing user interaction with the program.  \n",
